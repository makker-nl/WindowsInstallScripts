The installation of TortoiseSVN is in the BootStrap folder. It is recommended to have this in on a fileshare. New employees can run it from the fileshare and check out a first svn repository. In that repository you can put the rest of the installers as well as scripting to checkout out the other repositories. Doing so, you can have versioning on all the scripting, and have the smallest amount of scripting on a fileshare as a bootstrap.
